  A desktop or web application allowing users to create, manage,
  and position multiple independent "sticky notes" or "stickers"
  containing text. Inspired by the user-provided reference image.

# 2. Goals
# ----------------
goals:
  - Provide a simple interface for capturing quick text notes.
  - Allow notes to be freely positioned within the application window or screen.

  - Mimic the visual appearance of draggable cards/notes shown in the reference image.

# 3. Core Features
