# Product Requirements Document: Sticker Application Enhancement

## Overview
The Sticker application is a Windows desktop application that allows users to create and manage floating stickers on their screen. This PRD outlines enhancements to fix text content loading issues, implement test automation, and improve code architecture documentation.

## Current State
- The application is a Windows executable built with Electron
- Users can create, edit, move, and resize stickers
- Stickers persist between application restarts
- The application has a system tray icon for management
- OpenAI Whisper is used for speech-to-text functionality
- Text content is not consistently loading in stickers
- The application lacks automated testing

## Requirements

### 1. Fix Text Content Loading Issue
- Identify the root cause of text content not loading in stickers
- Implement a robust solution to ensure text content is consistently loaded
- Add error handling and logging to diagnose future issues
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing sticker data files

### 2. Test Automation Implementation
- Create a test automation framework that runs during development (`npm start`)
- Tests should not run in the packaged executable
- Implement unit tests for critical components
- Add integration tests for key user flows
- Create a test runner that can be triggered during development
- Tests should cover:
  - Sticker creation and deletion
  - Text content loading and saving
  - Sticker positioning and resizing
  - Speech-to-text functionality (using OpenAI Whisper)

### 3. Code Refactoring
- Refactor code to improve maintainability and readability
- Ensure proper ES module usage throughout the application
- Implement consistent error handling patterns
- Improve separation of concerns between components
- Optimize performance where possible

### 4. Architecture Documentation
- Create comprehensive architecture documentation in the docs folder
- Document the application's component structure
- Describe data flow and state management
- Detail the file storage mechanism
- Document the speech-to-text integration
- Include diagrams for visual clarity

### 5. Speech-to-Text Integration (Existing Feature)
- Maintain OpenAI Whisper API integration for speech-to-text conversion
- Ensure the microphone button on stickers works correctly
- Verify speech-to-text conversion is working properly

### 6. Error Handling
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Provide user feedback when operations fail
- Implement fallback mechanisms for offline scenarios

## Success Criteria
- Sticker text content loads reliably in all scenarios
- Test suite runs automatically during development
- Tests do not run in the packaged executable
- Code is well-structured and follows best practices
- Architecture documentation is comprehensive and clear
- The application remains stable and performant
