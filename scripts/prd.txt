# Product Requirements Document: Implementing OpenAI Whisper Speech-to-Text in Sticker Application

## Overview
The Sticker application is a Windows desktop application that allows users to create and manage floating stickers on their screen. We want to enhance this application by adding speech-to-text functionality using OpenAI's Whisper API, allowing users to create stickers by speaking rather than typing.

## Current State
- The application is a Windows executable built with Electron
- Users can create, edit, move, and resize stickers
- Stickers persist between application restarts
- The application has a system tray icon for management
- OpenAI API key is already configured in the .env file

## Requirements

### 1. Speech-to-Text Integration
- Implement OpenAI Whisper API integration for speech-to-text conversion
- Add a microphone button to stickers for recording speech
- Convert recorded speech to text and insert it into the sticker content

### 2. User Interface Updates
- Add a microphone button to each sticker
- Show recording status indicator when recording is active
- Provide visual feedback during speech processing

### 3. Audio Recording Functionality
- Implement audio recording capability in the Electron application
- Capture audio from the user's microphone
- Convert audio to the format required by the Whisper API

### 4. API Integration
- Use the existing OpenAI API key from the .env file
- Send recorded audio to the Whisper API
- Process the API response and update the sticker content

### 5. Error Handling
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Provide user feedback when speech recognition fails
- Implement fallback mechanisms for offline scenarios

### 6. Performance Considerations
- Optimize audio recording for quality and file size
- Implement efficient API communication
- Ensure the application remains responsive during speech processing

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully create and update stickers using speech
- The speech-to-text conversion is accurate and reliable
- The feature is intuitive and easy to use
- The application remains stable and performant with the new feature
